## SDF06 CSS Layout Practice - CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile

### Overview

In this project I was tasked to recreate a simplified version of an Instagram profile page using CSS layout and styling. This included flexbox and grid layout in CSS.

### Reflection
### Areas of Mastery

**CSS Layout Techniques**: I feel comfortable using flexbox as well as creating the format of a grid using HTML and CSS.

### Challenges Faced

**Gap spacing in the grid**: In the first and the lost row of my grid my images were spaced out but in the middle rows there was no space between them.
The space between the rows were also huge.
